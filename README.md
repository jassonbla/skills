Personal Agent Skills by [jassonbla](https://github.com/jassonbla).

This repository is a home for reusable agent workflows, instructions, templates, and reference materials. Each skill is self-contained under `skills/<skill-name>/` and includes a `SKILL.md` file with the instructions and metadata an agent needs to load it dynamically.

## Repository layout

```text
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json  # Claude Code plugin marketplace manifest
skills/                         # Skill packages
template/SKILL.md.template       # Minimal starting template for new skills
docs/                           # Repository-level notes and conventions
```

## Skill format

A skill is a folder with a required `SKILL.md` file:

```text
skills/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/   # optional durable reference files
├── examples/     # optional examples and fixtures
├── scripts/      # optional executable helpers; document safety clearly
└── assets/       # optional media or static assets
```

`SKILL.md` should start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when an agent should use it.
---
```

## Safety and privacy

- Do not commit credentials, tokens, private chat IDs, paid-newsletter content, or private customer data.
- Prefer examples and templates over personal state.
- If a skill includes scripts, document what they do, required dependencies, and safe usage.
- Keep personal configuration in the user's agent workspace, not in this public repository.

## Publishing model

There is no separate skills.sh submission flow. A skill is published by putting it in a public git repository and sharing it. When users install it with `npx skills add`, it can appear on skills.sh through anonymous install telemetry.
